# Build the Curator book: Markdown chapters -> HTML (pandoc) -> PDF (WeasyPrint).
#
#   docs/book/build.sh          builds docs/book/curator-book.ru.pdf from docs/book/ru/
#   docs/book/build.sh ru OUT   writes the PDF to OUT instead
#
# Needs pandoc 3.x and WeasyPrint 69+, and the PT Serif, PT Sans and PT Mono fonts.
#
# The chapters are checked first (docs/book/check.sh: hygiene and links), then
# the figures (docs/book/check-figures.sh): the structural pass always runs,
# the render pass (fresh and fitting SVGs) needs Python 3.11+ and the Graphviz
# the vendored diagram kit pins and fails the build otherwise.
# BOOK_SKIP_FIGURE_RENDER=1 skips only the render pass, with a warning. An
# image WeasyPrint cannot load also fails the build. Temporary HTML lives in a
# private directory under TMPDIR, never in the repository, and the PDF replaces
# OUT only after a clean run, so a failed build leaves the prior output as it was.
